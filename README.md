# MultiUser-Chat-Application

This is a multi user chat application which is part of my college's project work. Here I have divided the chat application into various phases.

Phase1: Creating a chat server with  server socket

Phase2: Accepting multiple connection

Phase3: Creating server worker to handle multiple clients



Phase 2.2 - Handling User Login (no ServerMain since no chages were made in ServerMain java file)
